            <li>Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman born on August 1st 1920 whose cancer cells are the source of the HeLa 'immortal' 
                cell line</li>
            <li>On January 29th 1951 she went to John Hopkins Hospital due to a ‘knot’ in her stomach and a biopsy was taken from her Cervix where 
                she was misdiagnosed with malignant epidermoid carcinoma of the cervix  </li>
            <li>When she was treated, two samples were taken from her cervix without her permission – one healthy and one cancerous. 
                The samples were given to George Otto Gey and the cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as HeLa cells </li>
            <li>Henrietta was admitted back to hospital on August 8th 1951 due to severe abdominal pain and received blood transfusions 
                until her death on October 4th 1951 as the cancer had metastasized throughout her entire body</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are HeLa cells and why are they so important?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>HeLa cells are the most widely used huamn cell line in biological research and have been critical for many biomedical breakthrough's </li>
            <li>When Henrietta's cells were taken without her consent they were given to a Physician George Otto Grey. He observed that her cancers cells 
                were different to normal ones in that they reproduced at a very high rate (rather than dividing a few times then dying off). </li>
            <li>They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey's standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient's 
                first and last names </li>
            <li>HeLa cells were the first human cells to be successfully cloned in 1953 by Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus at the University of 
                Colorado, Denver.Since that time, HeLa cells have "continually been used for research into cancer, AIDS, the effects of radiation and 
                toxic substances, gene mapping, and countless other scientific pursuits. </li>
            <li>1954, Jonas Salk was using HeLa cells in his research to develop the polio vaccine. To test his new vaccine, the cells were mass-produced
                 in the first-ever cell production factory </li>
            <li>Chester M. Southam, a leading virologist, injected HeLa cells into cancer patients, prison inmates, and healthy individuals in order to 
                observe whether cancer could be transmitted as well as to examine if one could become immune to cancer by developing an acquired immune 
                response.</li>
            <li>In 1953, a lab mistake involving mixing HeLa cells with the wrong liquid allowed researchers to see and count each chromosome clearly 
                in the HeLa cells they were working with for the first time. The accidental discovery led scientists Joe Hin Tjio and Albert Levan to
                develop better techniques for staining and counting chromosomes.They were the first to accurately describe that humans have 23 pairs 
                of chromosomes rather than 24, as was previously believed. This was important for the study of developmental disorders such as Downs
                syndrome that involved the number of chromosomes.</li>

        <h2>What is the controversy with them?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The main problem with HeLa cells is that they were obtained without the permission and consent of Henrietta Lacks or her family</li>
            <li>The cells were used in medical research and for commerical purposes, so some companies were profitting from Henrietta Lacks's cells</li>
            <li>The Lacks family objected to researchers publishing the DNA sequence of the genome of a strain of HeLa cells in 2013 as this genetic 
                information was available for public access</li>
            <li> There is now a change in the ethical ground-rules in the USA covering the taking and use of hospital biopsies without informed consent</li>
            <li>Henrietta Lacks and her cell line has now been recognised for the contribution to biomedical research and is celebrated by various Medical
                 Universities as well as the World Health Organisation</li>
