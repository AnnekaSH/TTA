        <h1>Producer</h1>

        <main class="main">
            Hello! I'm Priya, a creative producer based in London.<br><br> 

I've been knocking around the industry for over 8 years, creating storytelling content for broadcast and branded entertainment for some of the best: Guinness, The Olympic Channel, and Department for Transport to name a few.<br><br>

Unsurprisingly, I'm not wild about adverts in the traditional sense. But I've learnt a lot about effective craft and quality at some of the most creative studios in town so I'm always excited about pushing content in different shapes and sizes to entertain or have value in some way. From integrated advertising campaigns feat. celebrity talent to TV documentaries with animals, I've seen the lotâ€¦ but everyday is a school day in production.<br><br>

APA Masterclass trained, I also get involved in short films whenever I can - from developing and producing to simply running around on set. I love it all and I'm happy to muck in at every level when I have the time.<br><br>

If you're looking for a producer who can work their way around creatives, clients, crew, call sheets, catering and things that don't start with C also, drop me a line!<br><br>
