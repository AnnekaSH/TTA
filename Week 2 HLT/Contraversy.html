        <h2>What is the contraversy with them?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The main problem with HeLa cells is that they were obtained without the permission and consent of Henrietta Lacks or her family</li>
            <li>The cells were used in medical research and for commerical purposes, so some companies were profitting from Henrietta Lacks's cells</li>
            <li>The Lacks family objected to researchers publishing the DNA sequence of the genome of a strain of HeLa cells in 2013 as this genetic 
                information was available for public access</li>
            <li> There is now a change in the ethical ground-rules in the USA covering the taking and use of hospital biopsies without informed consent</li>
            <li>Henrietta Lacks and her cell line has now been recognised for the contribution to biomedical research and is celebrated by various Medical
                 Universities as well as the World Health Organisation</li>
        </ul>
